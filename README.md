# anime

A self-hosted, static anime tracker akin to
[MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) (MAL).

Currently there are no data sources beyond that provided by MAL's XML export,
so it is not possible to compute statistics that require metadata (e.g.
days watched, release year, etc.). In the future, this may be possible with
[aniDB](https://anidb.net/) or similar integration.
